		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Nothing settles the belly after a long day like potato soup. Thick, creamy, and hearty, this soup is sure to please.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lbs <b>potatoes</b>, <i>peeled and cubed</i></li>
			<li>1 large <b>onion</b>, <i>diced</i></li>
			<li>1 small <b>carrot</b>, <i>diced</i></li>
			<li>1 tbsp <b>herbs de provence</b></li>
			<li>2 tsp <b>salt</b></li>
			<li>4 cloves <b>garlic</b>, <i>minced</i></li>
			<li>6 cloves <b>garlic</b>, <i>sliced</i></li>
			<li>4 cups <b>vegetable stock</b></li>
			<li>7oz <b>smoked cheddar cheese</b> or <b>normal cheddar</b> + &frac12; tsp <b>smoked paprika</b></li>
			<li>&frac12; cup <b>sour cream</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat olive oil in a soup pot or large saucepan, over a medium heat. Sauté the onion and carrot until soft.</li>
			<li>Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.</li>
			<li>Add the herbs de provence, salt, and the potatoes and mix everything together. If you are using smoked paprika instead of the smoked cheese, now would be the time to add it.</li>
			<li>Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes, until the potatoes are very soft and starting to break up.</li>
			<li>Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes down further and add creaminess to the soup, while retaining some texture and chunky bits.</li>
			<li>Now prepare your fried garlic. Heat a thin layer of olive oil in a small saucepan—just enough to cover it. Add the garlic slices and fry until just browned.</li>
			<li>Add the garlic slices to the soup, reserving a few for a garnish if you wish.</li>
			<li>Remove from the heat and stir through the smoked cheddar until melted through.</li>
			<li>Add the sour cream, mixing through until the soup is creamy.</li>
			<li>Cover and let the soup sit for 5-10 minutes before serving to let the flavors come together.</li>
			<li>Serve. You can garnish with some reserved fried garlic, chives, and a swirl of sour cream if you wish.</li>
